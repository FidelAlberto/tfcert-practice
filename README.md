So, it's Septembert 29th now. I'm taking the exam tomorrow. My biggest gratitude goes to thầy Ngọc, bạn Thành trợ giảng and other "classmates" for helping me revising for this exam.

Just a few notes to myself:
- Stay calm.
- "It can be good, it can be bad. But at the end of the day, it's always good."

So just do your best <3 I'm proud of you.
